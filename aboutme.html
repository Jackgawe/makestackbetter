            <h1>About Me</h1>
           
            
            <p>I started coding in 2017. Back then, I was quite new to the subject, but I still adored computers, so I continued learning. I was coding in Scratch, then, I dedcided to move into more advanced langauges. My first non Scratch related coding lanaguage was Python, and to this day it is still my favourite. Based off of this website you can tell that I also know CSS & HTMl. I plan to learn JavaScript next. Then, I will learn Java. Once I've done that, I may learn a few variants of 'C'. Then, I will go over all of the langauges I know to refresh my memory.</p>
